## Introduction

SCINE ReaDuct is a command-line tool that allows to carry out

- single point calculations,
- Hessian calculations,
- structure optimizations,
- transition state searches,
- intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations, and
- artificial force induced reaction (AFIR) calculations.

For these calculations, it relies on a backend program to provide the necessary
quantum chemical properties (such as nuclear gradients). Currently, SCINE Sparrow
and ORCA are supported as backend programs.
